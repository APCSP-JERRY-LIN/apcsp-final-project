Design a Game Project Rubric
| Key Concept | Extensive Evidence | Convincing Evidence | Limited Evidence | No Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Program Development | Your project guide is complete and reflects the project as submitted. Your project guide is mostly complete and is generally reflective of the submitted project. | Your project guide is filled out, but is not complete or does not reflect the submitted project. | Your project guide is incomplete or missing. |
| Program Readability | Your program code effectively uses whitespace, good naming conventions, indentation and comments to make the code easily readable. | Your program code makes use of whitespace, indentation, and comments. | Your program code has few comments and does not consistently use formatting such as whitespace and indentation. | Your program code does not contain comments and is difficult to read. |
| Use of Functions | At least three functions are used to organize your code into logical segments. At least one of these functions is called multiple times in your program. | At least two functions are used in your program to organize your code into logical segments. | At least one function is used in your program. | There are no functions in your program. |
| Backgrounds and Variables | Your game has at least three backgrounds that are displayed during run time, and at least one change is triggered automatically through a variable (e.g. score). | Your game has multiple backgrounds that are displayed during run time (e.g. main background and “end game” screen) | Your game has multiple backgrounds. | Your game does not have multiple backgrounds. |
| Interactions and Controls | Your game includes multiple different interactions between sprites, and it responds to multiple types of user input (e.g. different arrow keys). | Your game includes at least one type of sprite interaction and it responds to user input. | Your game responds to user input through a conditional. | Your game includes no conditionals. |
| Position and Movement | Complex movement such as acceleration, moving in a curve, or jumping is included in multiple places in your program. | Your program includes some complex movement, such as jumping, acceleration, or moving in a curve. | Your program includes simple independent movement, such as a straight line or rotation. | There is no movement in your program, other than direct user control. |
| Variables | Your game includes multiple variables that are updated during the game and affect how the game is played. | Your game includes at least one variable that is updated during the game and affects the way the game is played | There is at least one variable used in your program. | There are no variables, or they are not updated. |
