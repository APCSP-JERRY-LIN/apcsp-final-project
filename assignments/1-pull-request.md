# Assignment 1: Pull Request

The source files for this project are called a _repository_. The repository currently exist in two places:

1. **Berti's Macbook** (_local repository_)
2. **Github's servers** (_remote repository_)

When collaborating with other programmers, we often _pull_ repositories to our own computer (creating a new _local repository_), make some changes, then _push_ the changes to the _remote repository_. These changes are then approved and merged into the _remote repository_ in a process called a _pull request_. Anyone can then go and _pull_ the updated code into our _local repository_, then make changes and repeat the process. The resulting code is a collaboration between all those who pushed changes to the repository.

For this assignment, you will be making changes to the _remote repository_.
