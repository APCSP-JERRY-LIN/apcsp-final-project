| Key Concept | Extensive Evidence | Convincing Evidence | Limited Evidence | No Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Project Preparation | Step 1 and 2 is filled out completely. The issue statement is clear and each brainstorm field in Step 2 has at least one app idea. | Step 1 and 2 are mostly filled out, but the issue statement may be unclear or there is not an app idea in each brainstorm field in Step 2 | Step 1 and 2 are mostly filled out, but the issue statement does not meet the guidelines or multiple boxes or prompts are left blank in Step 2 | Steps 1 and 2 of the project guide are blank |
| Survey and Data Collection | Steps 3-5 are filled out completely. Responses are thoughtful and reflective of the community that is submitting data. An effort was made to collect data from the community, even if there are not a lot of responses. | Steps 3-5 are filled out completely, but responses are generic or vague and are not specific to the community that is submitting data. An effort was made to collect data from the community, even if there are not a lot of responses. | Steps 3-5 are mostly filled out, but some responses are blank. Or, no effort was made to collect data from the community. | Steps 3-5 are blank and no effort was made to collect data from the community |
| Creating a Model | Step 6 is completed. You trained a model either from survey data or a provided dataset, and answers to the prompts are clear and reflective | Step 6 is completed. You trained a model either from survey data or a provided dataset, but the answers to the prompts are unclear or generic | Step 6 is mostly completed, but at least one prompt is blank. You trained a model either from survey data or a provided dataset. | You did not train a model from a survey or provided dataset |
| Model Card | Your model card is complete, with detailed information in the intended uses and limitations sections of the model card.  | Your model card is complete. The intended uses and limitations sections are complete, but are vague or generic without considering your specific data or survey | Your model card is mostly complete, but at least one box is blank. The intended uses and limitations sections are complete, but are vague or generic without considering your specific data or survey | Your model card is mostly complete, but at least one box is blank. At least one of the intended uses or limitations sections are blank. |
| Creating an App | The app works without error and includes a welcome screen and a theme. The app incorporates information from the model card into the app, such as the accuracy, intended use, or warnings. | The app works without error and includes a welcome screen and a theme. | The app works without error, but does not contain a welcome screen or theme - it may be a single-screen app. | App is not complete or does not work |
| Reflection | Step 8 is completed with detailed and specific answers. You list specific improvements you would make to your data collection, model, and app. | Step 8 is completed, but some answers may be vague or unclear. You were still able to test your app with another person, but your improvements may not be specific | Step 5 is completed, but most answers are vague or unclear or you were not able to test the app with another person. | Step 8 of the project guide is incomplete or blank. |
